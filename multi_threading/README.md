Here multiple pre-tested `.csv` files and python program used to generate test files in large test cases (`order_csv_generator.py`) are included. Apart from that two `.h` files namely, [utils.h](multi_threading\utils.h) and [processes.h](multi_threading\processes.h) contains the aspects of the program to read, write the `.csv` files and process them. [parallized_trader.cpp](multi_threading\parallized_trader.cpp) is used to parallely run the [processes.h](multi_threading\processes.h).
