# OLD Version

Here Included the first attempt on the task by a sequence process. Here also I have included the `.csv` file generating Python program [order_csv_generator.py](order_csv_generator.py) and some pre-generated `.csv` files.

There are a few Versions of the program included.
- [Trader. cpp](Trader.cpp): Contains the basic executable program without any advanced algorithms. The complexity of the project also abstracted to obtain the basic functionality

- [Trader_using_priority_queue.cpp](Trader_using_priority_queue.cpp): Earlier Versions have been updated here with the priority queue algorithm.

- [Trader_using_priority_queue_tradeLogic.cpp](Trader_using_priority_queue_tradeLogic.cpp): Further modified to fullfill all the requirements except the error handling and time calculation.
